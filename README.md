# Password Dialog for Cordova

This is a [Cordova](http://cordova.apache.org/) plugin for showing password prompt dialogs.

Currently this has a single dialog: change password. It allows the user to enter their current, new, and confirmation passwords.

# Install

To add the plugin to your Cordova project, simply add the plugin from the npm registry:

    cordova plugin add cordova-plugin-password-dialog

Alternatively, you can install the latest version of the plugin directly from git:

    cordova plugin add https://github.com/Justin-Credible/cordova-plugin-password-dialog

# Usage

The plugin is available via a global variable named `PasswordDialogPlugin`. It exposes the following properties and functions.

All functions accept optional success and failure callbacks as their final two arguments, where the failure callback will receive an error string as an argument unless otherwise noted.

A TypeScript definition file for the JavaScript interface is available in the `typings` directory as well as on [DefinitelyTyped](https://github.com/borisyankov/DefinitelyTyped) via the `tsd` tool.
